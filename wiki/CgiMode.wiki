#summary Explains how to run Karrigell behind the Apache web server
#sidebar TableOfContents

Karrigell can be run with a built-in web server, but it can also be used with the Apache web server. When it receives a request for a Python script, Apache will launch the Python interpreter and run a CGI script that will execute the script and return the result to the browser

There are a couple of things you must know in order to get things running :
  * the path of the Python interpreter on the file system of the server
  * the document root (the absolute path of the directory where scripts stand)
  * the URL path of the CGI directory on the server (usually /cgi-bin)

This information and other options must be declared in the configuration file <font color="#106010" face="courier">cgi.ini</font>, located in the directory <font color="#106010" face="courier">cgi</font> of the Karrigell distribution. Detailed explanations are given on the expected values

Once you have filled it, run the script make_cgi_config.py : it will generate a package located in the subdirectory <font color="#106010" face="courier">cgi-package</font>, consisting in 2 directories :
  * <font color="#106010" face="courier">cgi-bin</font> : its content must be copied or uploaded on the server's CGI directory
  * <font color="#106010" face="courier">root_directory</font> : its content must be copied or uploaded on the document root

When this is done, you can start the Apache server ; it will serve requests exactly like with the built-in web server
